The validator should take an IsEntity in and throw exceptions if it has
validation problems. It should also be able to return a map that has column
names pointing to exception classes. It should validate based off of the Column
annotations. It need not do validation on references because one can not persist
an Entity that references an unpersisted Entity. It will need to validate
embedded objects.

1. Take in an IsStorable
2. Throw exceptions do to validation constraints based on @Column annotation
    a. Unique constraint
    b. test for length
    c. test for null value allowed
    d. test by regular expression
