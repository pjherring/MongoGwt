Create

Our creation code should only do one thing, persist a pojo. Therefore, any
entity given to it that is already persisted (in this case has an ID) should be
rejected, and there should be an exception thrown. It should set the newly
persisted objects ID and createdDatetime. It should only persist Objects that
implement IsEntity and is annotated with Entity and is in the list of valid
entities designated from our Guice module.

Reqs
    1. Persists an entity
    2. Sets the id and createdDatetime after persistance
    3. Does not persist already persisted entites but throws an exception
    4. Does not persist entities that are not valid
        b. Including objects that are not annotated with Entity
        c. Including objcets not in the Entity List
