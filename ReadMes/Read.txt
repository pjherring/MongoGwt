The Read class should be able to find, findOne, and findById. It should be able
to fan out the Entities, meaning include their referenced objects fully loaded,
or it should be able to no fan out, meaning just include the id's of their
reference objects. Also, it should not hold attributes that have a getter with a
Column annotation, but any References that are managed by other Entities.

1. Find, findOne, findById
2. Do fanOut full referenced entities
3. don't fan out, referenced entities with id's only
4. Set attributes annotated with Column and Reference
